## WHO MADE THIS?

I did, with a little help from the internet. Thanks, internet.

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is a simple day planner. Any notes you create persist after a page refresh and even if you close the browser and reopen it. The hour block will also change color to let you know which hours have passed, which is the current hour, and which hours remain throughout the day.

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

Simply enter your note or task in an hour block and press the __Update Planner__ button. You can enter notes or tasks in multiple hour blocks before updating the planner if you wish. Once an hour block is filled in, a __Remove Button__ will appear. Press that button to remove that note or task. If you wish to clear the entire planner press the __Clear Planner__ button.

## WHY DID I MAKE THIS?

This was a homework assignment for a full-stack web developement boot camp. It was created to show understanding of __jQuery__, navigating and manipulating the __DOM__, and storing and accessing __Local Storage__.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

I would like to add a toggle switch that changes the time format of the hour labels, a way to select the range of hours you want to display, and for the planner to refresh once a new day starts.
